## Projects

<p> Project 1: Calculator of the online school of Unit Economics </p>

<p> What needed to be done: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Take into account the adjustment of marketing plans in the calculator</li>
  <li>Recalculate the teacher recruitment plan</li>
</ol>

<p> As decided: </p>
<p> Task 1 </p>
<ol>
  <li> Added the indicator "Correction factor for attraction" to the list of calculator parameters. </li>
  <li> Set the default value of this indicator as 100% and added the ability to change this indicator for the billing period 05.21-04.22 - through the "Change" column. </li>
  <li> Set up a dynamic calculation of the number of new students for the period 05.21-04.22 adjusted for this coefficient. </li>
  <li> I calculated a scenario in which marketing plans will be increased by 12% (other indicators remained the same). </li>
</ol>
<p> Result: updated sheet with calculator + new estimated number of students on 04.2022 </p>
<p> Task 2 </p>
<ol> 
  <li> Added to the Teacher Recruitment calculator the ability to change input parameters: Bandwidth P and Retention P. </li>
  <li> Made an amendment in the calculation of the total throughput - changed the formula so as to reflect that new teachers in the first month of their work can conduct only half of the lessons from the average throughput of the teacher set by the parameter. </li>
  <li> Updated the predicted number of lessons by adding new values from Task 1 (obtained after adjusting for marketing plans). </li>
  <li> I calculated a scenario in which the bandwidth of the N will increase by 15 percent, and Retention N will drop by 2 percent. </li>
  <li> Using the Search for solutions, I made a new recruitment plan with a restriction: it is impossible to hire more than 70 teachers in a month. </li>
</ol>
<p> Result: Updated recruitment plan - with the number of new teachers by month for the period from 05.2021 to 04.2022 </p>
